When the package is setup in non-interactive mode, the password for
/etc/dtc-xen/htpasswd is set randomly. In that case, you will need to setup
a new password by running dpkg-reconfigure dtc-xen.

Note also that if the package is not configured correctly, then the SOAP server
wont be able to bind as the hostname will be wrong. Once again,
dpkg-reconfigure dtc-xen will solve this problem. Of course, making this
hostname resolvable for example by editing your /etc/hosts or your DNS IS
mandatory.
