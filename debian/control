Description: A small firewall script for your dom0
 If running in a production environment, you might want to have a basic
 firewall running on your dom0 to avoid having DoS attack. This is not the
 state-of-the-art, but just another attempt to make things a bit more smooth.
 Comments and contribution are more than welcome!
