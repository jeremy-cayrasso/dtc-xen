 Dtc-xen creates physical partitions in an existing LVM volume group
 .
 Please enter that volume group name. The volume group size must fit

Template: dtc-xen/conf_info_finish_setup

 To finish the installation, you need to launch
 /usr/sbin/dtc-xen_finish_install.

 This script will remove port forwarding from the current sshd_config
 file and add the grant of xm console to the group xenusers so that
 users can login to the physical console. It will then try to
 download the files needed to setup Gentoo and CentOS into the
 virtual machines. 
 .
 Please note that the system is currently safe (connections to a
 physical console as xenXX will be rejected because the /etc/sudoers
 is not changed), but a basic user won't be able to log into his
 physical console using ssh.
