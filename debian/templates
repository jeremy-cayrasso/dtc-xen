 care if loopback is slower), leave this as default and it wont use it anyway.

Template: dtc-xen/conf_info_finish_setup
Type: note
_Description: How to finish the install
 To finish the installation, you need to launch
 /usr/sbin/dtc-xen_finish_install. This script will remove port
 forwarding from your sshd_config and add the grant of xm console
 to the group xenusers so your users can loggin to the physical
 console. It will then try to download the files needed to setup
 Gentoo and CentOS into your VMs. Note that the system is currently
 safe (nobody can connect to a physical console as xenXX, they will
 be rejected because the /etc/sudoers is not changed), but a basic
 user wont be able to log into his physical console using ssh.
