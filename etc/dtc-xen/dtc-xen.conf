# Previously, DTC-Xen was using the node number (which doesn't exist in this
# version of DTC-Xen) to calculate this number, this is not the case anymore,
# you HAVE to edit it to avoid MAC addresses conflicts, otherwise Xen will
# pickup a random MAC for you, which could be very problematic. Note that this
# is a prefix, the DTC-Xen VPS number will be added at the end of the string,
# making something like: mac=00:00:20:00:00:XX where XX is the VPS number.
